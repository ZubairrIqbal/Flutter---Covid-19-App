COVID-19 Tracker App
This is a Flutter-based COVID-19 tracking app that showcases real-time data fetched from an external API. The app includes features such as API integration, custom loading animations, and a shimmer effect for a sleek and responsive user experience.

Features:
API Integration: Fetches real-time COVID-19 statistics.
Shimmer Effect: Displays a shimmering placeholder while data loads.
Loading Animation: Custom animation controller for smooth transitions during data loading.
This project helped me dive into Flutter's capabilities with network requests and user interface enhancements.
